GoldRaidManager 3.3.x 10.0.1.19 backported to WoW TBC 2.4.3

Youtube video explaning how to use the addon:
https://youtu.be/2FiXr4XQkHk

Can handle all aspects of a Gold DKP (GDKP) run:
Auction Tab:		Auctioning items, splitting gold between the amount of boosters you set, disenchanting if no bets and only if available. 
Briefing Tab:		Store many different briefing messages and output to raid on-demand. 
Reserve Log Tab:	Reserve items for players.
Loot Log Tab:		Display who bought the items and for what price. 
Auto Advertise Tab:	Automaticly Advertise the run in up to 3 channels, option to set output interval.

Known issues:
* If your client crashes during the raid, the addon can't store the data. If you get disconnected the addon will store the data!
* When using with /stopwatch or /timer, the auction count does not work normally.
* I can't figure out how the Gold per Deal (Gold Log) part of Reserve Log works and I need help to understand what it's supposed to work in order to translate it.
  Recommend not using Gold per Deal ("Gold Log" and "Reserve (Player) Log" button under "Reserve Log" until it's properly translated. 

Known bugs:
* Advertising message doesn't display the text you type and doesn't copy the text to the no input Memo box. It Still works, you are just typing blindly. 
* Clicking on "Instant Adv" in the Auto Advertise Tab while no message is entered, doesn't respond with an error message, outputs blank text in chat.
